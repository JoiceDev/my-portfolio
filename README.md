# My Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, where I showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey as a developer. I adapted this project from an open-source template to better reflect my own style and background.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** â€“ React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation  
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ Utility-first CSS framework for styling  
- **React** â€“ Library for building user interfaces  
- **React Icons** â€“ Icon set for React projects  
- **TypeScript** â€“ Superset of JavaScript for type safety  
- **Resend** â€“ Email API used for the contact form
